	 static methods:
		Character.isDigit(10)
		can be called using Class Names, it belongs to the class
		can be called using object name
	
	static methods vs instance methods
	1) instance methods can be called only using the object name
	2) static methods can ONLY reach static variables or methods
	instance methods can call both static and instance	
		
		Instance variables or methods: THese belongs to objects created
		
	** 3 Friends of Initialization
	1) Static initializer block (runs before everything else, only once when class is loaded by ClassLoader)
	2) Instance initializer block (runs each time object is created, before constructor)
	3) Constructor (initializer block) (runs each time object is created)
	
	Inheritance:
	=============
	* a class can inherit the properties/behavior of another class
	* it is providing us reusability and maintainability
	* it is also a good way to organize our code
	* we use extends key word
	
	public ChildClass extends ParentClass(){}
	
	Inheritance creates "is A" relationship
	
	"has A" relationship 
	
	*** JAVA does NOT support multiple inheritance, class can extend only one another class
	----with abstraction it becomes possible-----
